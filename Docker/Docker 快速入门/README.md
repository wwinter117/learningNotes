# Docker概述？

>Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

简单来说就是Docker就是一个平台（容器平台），方便开发、迁移以及运行我们的应用软件。

将软件与基础设施分离，独立于底层的基础设施，也就是说可以在Linux、Windows、VM等等上运行，方便软件迁移。

可以快速迁移、测试、部署我们的应用，节约时间成本。

>Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way
